# LendaskMIDI
Lendask MIDI is a tutorial that reflect my own journey for a simple and elegant way of making my own USB MIDI controller. 

Lendask is intended to be flexible, cheap, and easy to make.

###################

Lendask uses:

teensy 3.2

Arduino IDE 1.8.9

teensyduino/Teensy Loader 1.46

up to 21 knobs/faders 

up to 16 buttons


###################

Additional Materials:

Wires (solid core is great)

PCB Female Pin Headers

Solder and Soldering Iron

Wire Stripper

Sturdy Case

Drill with Bits

microUSB cable

To give you an estimate on price, if you also have to buy the tools, you are looking at around 70$

#############################

First thing is first, make sure that you can upload code to your teensy. a common problem is that the micro USB cable you are using is actually a charging only cable, not a data cable. I too encountered this common problem.


You will need to solder pin headers to the teensy in order to use the most of its many analog inputs.
